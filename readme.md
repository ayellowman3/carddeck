Write a simple class in the language of your choice to represent a deck of cards with operations to shuffle the deck and to deal one card. While not a requirement today, a likely future enhancement is the need to deal all the cards in a deck. While not strictly required, we value usage instructions, nicely-modeled data, automated tests, and thoughtful consideration of architectural decisions and simplicity-vs-completeness trade-offs.
